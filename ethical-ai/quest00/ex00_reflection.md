   # How have use Ai for coding so far? 
   ***Ans:*** When I am stuck after trying, i use Ai to understand errors and clarify the problem, then learn from the explanation.

   # Do i usually try problem myself?
   ***Ans:*** Not always, but lately I am striving to try longer before using Ai.

   # Can i explain code i have submitted without Ai help?
   ***Ans:*** As a beginner yes for simple problems. for more difficult ones likes recursion, i study solutions line by line to understand them, and I'm working towards solving them independently.

   # What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?
   ***Ans:*** I would solve what i can and push through the harder problems, like i did during my Piscine trials.

   # Identify your current pattern:
   ***Ans:*** Right now, i am about 70% learner A, but i am actively working towards becoming learner B

   # Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.
   ***Ans:*** i am currently building a Tech foundation by learning consistently and improving my problem solving skills, i am disciplined and open to feedback from peers and also using tools like Ai to learn faster while still thinking independently. I want to become a positive, self driven learner who understands concepts deeply, adapt quickly and can solve real world problems without relying on Ai.
