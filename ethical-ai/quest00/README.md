***What I Learned***

I Learned that Ai is a great learning and efficiency but true skills comes from understanding and doing things myself and using Ai tool fairly after trying it on my own builds problem solving ability and confidence in a circumstances where Ai isnt available.

***My Main Insight On Using Ai Ethically***

My main insight is that Ai should be used to support learning and understanding, not by replacing your thinking Ability as a programmer

***How I Will Apply Principle Going Forward***

1. Attempt problems by myself before asking Ai.
2. I will use Ai to clarify concept, review my mistakes and try to explore alternatives.
3. I will Understand the reasoning behind every solution and how component interact.
4. Reflect on my approach to strengthen my problem solving skills and self reliance.
