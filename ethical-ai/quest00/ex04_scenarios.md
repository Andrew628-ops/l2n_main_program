# Interview:

I would struggle if i only rely on Ai which is the reason i now priotize understanding system design fundamentals.

# Production Bug: 

I would find it a bit hard if i have not taken the time to understand the code. that why i now made a habit of reviewing and understanding Ai code rather than relying fully on it so i can debug later.

# New Technology:

I would learn from documentation and take on small test project and depend on my fundamentals rather than depending on that of Ai.

# Reflection:

Making use of Ai fairly helps me build my understanding rather than depending on it. by attempting problems first and using Ai tool to only clarify and improve my thinking. this prepares me to handle exams, job text and real world bugs confidently.
